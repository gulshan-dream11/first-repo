Indexing is a way of speeding up the record search in a table by minimizing the disk I/O calls. \

Indexes:
- Primary or Clustered
- Secondary or non-clustered
- B trees
- Hash-index

Clustered indexes are used when the table is sorted by the column we want to index. It falls under sparse index. Only 1 index can be created in this case.\
We can create multiple non-clustered indexes for a table corresponding to multiple columns. These non-clustered indexes are stored as seperate entity and have pointers pointing to the main table. Non-clustered indexes are dense.\

B trees are an instance of m-way search trees with some rules on them. These tree structures store the record pointer corresponding to every key in the node. B trees have bottom-up approach of filling the keys. While filling keys if the number of keys exceed degree of the tree then splitting and re-arranging happens. Splitting can be left biased or right biased depending on which side we want to keep more number of children.\

Hash indexes are created with the help of hashing mechanism. The search key "k" is hashed with function "f" which gives the bucket number for that key. In case of multiple search keys falling into a bucket a chain is created. These buckets entries have pointers to the main table entries.\
